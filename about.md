### Brief Intro

I'm currently a Master at School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University. I get my undergraduate degree in Applied Mathematics at [School of Mathematical Science](http://math.fudan.edu.cn/), [Fudan University](http://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/). I used to be interested in the intersection of deep learning and mathematics, but now I'm more interested in parallel programming and network.

### Education

B.S. in Applied Mathematics, <a href="http://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/">Fudan University</a>.

Master of Information Technology, [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), expected 2020.
